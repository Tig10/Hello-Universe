A repo to store resources and some ideas

Greetings Humans!

Tigere here, just a little bit about me.. I really like VanillaJS, nothing against frameworks. I think JS is a general purpose language that has far reaching use-cases beyond dynamic websites. I am a big fan of such technologies which brings me to Python. I love Python although I work as a full-stack lead on LAMP stack for an ISP in the UK. In my spare time I am also learning Golang, and reading books. 

I visit one news website once a week and that site is HACKER NEWS. I dream about going back to my planet as soon as I can rebuild my ship.
For now I just stick around and wander about earth and code as it is the thing I love to do the most also I need some serious coding skills to build my ship's os.
